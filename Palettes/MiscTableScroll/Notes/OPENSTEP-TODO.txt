TODO:
----
- Ditch use of PS-wrap on MacOS/X Server if possible since DisplayPostScript
    is deprecated.   Instead use NSDottedFrameRect().  Note that this function
    is available as of OpenStep 4.2, but not earlier.

- Ditch use of all other direct PostScript calls on MacOS/X Server if possible.
    This will affect MiscLineWrapper, MiscTableView, MiscTableViewPrint at
    minimum.

- Write 3.3 -> 4.x porting document.  Describe changes between the versions.
    Describe major gotchas.  Describe tops script.

- MISC_FRAME_HEIGHT should be derived at run-time from the height of
    an MiscBorderCell rather than being hard-coded at compile-time.  There
    is no guarantee that the hard-coded value will be the correct for any
    given platform.

- All of the exporters are merely taking -lossyCString.  This may be suitable
    for ASCII and DBF, but it needs to be reviewed and probably use NSString
    methods for doing as much of the work as possible.

- Exporters are allocating arrays of integers.  Should probably upgrade to
    NSArray of NSNumber.

- Rewrite the pasteboard code.  Apparently I broke the "subclassibility" when
    I ported it.  Paul says that the methods should be writing to something
    like an NSData object rather than returning strings so that subclasses
    can write whatever appropriate data types they may have.  Don't just
    limit it to strings.

- Consider making all instance variables completely private by hiding them
    behind a single _priv instance variable as is done with some of the
    Foundation and AppKit objects.  Now that TableScroll is a framework, this
    could prevent potential problems with subclasses if/when we need to add
    or remove instance variables.


DONE:
----
v140.1
- Port to MacOS/X Server DR2.
- Update all nib files to conform to new UI guidelines; example programs too.
- Fix compilation using ProjectUnity so that project compiles on OpenStep 4.2
    as well as MacOS/X Server for Mach and Windows.
- Expose MiscTableScroll, MiscTableCell, and MiscExporter to Java.
- Turn notification-style delegate messages into real notifications in order to
    be more OPENSTEP compliant and flexible.  (Obviously this can't be done for
    methods which return a value, but it can be done for the others.)
    Automatically register the delegates as recipients of the new
    notifications.
- Update 'tops' script to reflect delegate messsages which now receive
    NSNotification.
- Ensure that file owner and permissions are correct on all nib files after
    editing them to conform to latest UI guidelines.
- For Java consistency, move notification-style delegate messages into a
    Notifications category/interface.
- Document new notifications.  Fix delegate method documentation to indicate
    that delegate now recieves NSNotifcation for specific messages.
- Rename NSIBConnector.h to NSNibConnector.h.
- For better OpenStep conformance, rename these methods.  Also update 'tops'
    script, 'jobs' script, and documentation to reflect the changes.

- Add "Using TableScroll from Java" section to MiscTableScroll.rtf.
- Add support for setting of "represented object".  Client should be able to
    set represented object for the entire TableScroll as well as for each
    slot.  Retain the represented object when set and release it when cleared.
    Also release it when storage for the represented object array in the
    border is freed.  To be consistent with the AppKit, must also save and
    restore the represented object during archiving and unarchiving.  Add new
    methods to Java 'jobs' file.  Document new methods, and document the fact
    that the represented object is retained, released, and archived.  Add "See
    Also" entries to -tag and -setTag: which refer to the represented object.
    Likewise, refer to -tag and -setTag: from the represented object methods.
- Verify that new notification variables are properly exported on Windows.
- Fix platform.make in all projects.  It incorrectly prefixes Windows variables
    with $(NEXT_ROOT) even though the "real" YellowBox makefiles do not.
    Also add $(NEXT_ROOT) to all installation directories as appropriate in
    project files.
- Blast the unused & invalid PrivateHeaders link in the installed framework.
- Fix README to take directory structure differences into account between
    MacOS/X Server and OpenStep.  Also document new Java exposure.
- Before generating final package, fix permissions on *.sh and RCS/*.sh,v
    files since the execute-bit keeps getting clobbered by Windows.
- Remove unused functions from mcgh2misc.sh: SETUP_DOCS(), SETUP_HEADERS().
- Update mcgh2misc scripts to handle new Java exposure.  At minimum, need to
    add "jobs" file to list of files to convert.  Also need to include new
    platform.make and make.sh.  Take extra special care with make.sh since
    normally all *.sh files are blasted by the script.  Also convert Java
    package name from org.misckit to org.misckit.  Convert .sed script and
    .java files inside new Java subproject as well.
- Fix mcgh2misc to filter output of Emacs batch processing so that only
    important messages are displayed.
- Fix mcgh2misc to accept source and target directories on the command line.
    If not specified, use "." for source and "$(HOME)" for target.  Remove
    requirement that script must be run from within MiscTableScroll directory.
- Fix mcgh2misc so that it checks out files from source RCS directly into
    target directories instead of first copying RCS directories to target
    and only then performing check out.  Should be able to remove the copy
    step altogether.
- Fix mcgh2misc to automatically copy MiscKit license files into package.

v138.1
- Honor the user's color preferences by taking advantage of the new
    NSColor "system" color methods.
- Change MiscBorderCell so that it more closely matches NSTableHeaderCell
    aesthetically.

v133.1
- Update all -makeCellsPerform: methods to -makeCellsPerformSelector:.  Also
    fix 'tops' script accordingly.

v128.1
- Fix mcgh2misc scripts to handle new framework/palette structure as soon as
    I hear back from Mr. MiscKit about the organization he requires for
    MiscKit 2.0.  [07/07/97 - He has failed to answer the two letters I sent
    him about this.  I'm just going to organize it the way I feel like
    organizing it.]
