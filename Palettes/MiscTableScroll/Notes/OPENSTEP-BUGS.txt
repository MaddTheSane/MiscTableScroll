BUGS:
----
- TableScroll is not receiving a -becomeFirstResponder message on Rhapsody DR2
    when it is first unarchived from the nib and is the window's "initial
    first responder".  Consequently, it does not have a chance to notify
    NSFontManager as to the current font setting.  (-becomeFirstResponder is
    correctly sent in other circumstances.)

- Cursor rectangles do not work correctly on MacOS/X Server DR2 when mouse
    moves vertically into rectangles.  The problem is the overlapping
    rectangles.  I fixed this problem for horizontal mouse movement already by
    eliminating some of the overlap on the DR2 platform.  The overlapping
    rectangles are a work-around for buggy cursor rectangles on pre-DR2
    platforms which do not handle small adjacent rectangles correctly.

- MacOS/X Server DR2 changed the modifier keys used for extending selection.
    On earlier platforms, shift is used to extend the selection incrementally,
    and alt is used to extend it by an entire range.  With DR2, cmd is now
    used for incremental selection, and shift extends by range.

- LineWrapper isn't handling composed character sequences.  In fact, it's
    using -lossyCString.

- LineWrapper::draw() doesn't handle NSAttributedStrings.  It assumes that
    strings will be drawn in a single font entirely.

- Incremental-search should be handling composed character sequences and
    Unicode via NSString.

- The -keyDown: method in MiscTableScroll is only considering the first
    character from the key-down event rather than all of them.

- Dragging, resizing, etc.  a slot while cell editing is in progress causes
    the cell to be redrawn with the old contents for the duration of the drag,
    resize, etc. operation, at which time the new contents are restored.
    This bug also afflicts the NEXTSTEP MiscTableScroll, but only when
    dragging the column if it was only partially visible.  The MiscTableScroll
    architecture does not easily lend itself to fixing this problem.


NeXT BUGS:
---------
- There is a display bug *during* dragging.  It appears that the composite
    operations are messing up the images.  For instance, as soon as you pick
    up a column, the image of the column gets a slightly dithered appearance
    (that's the best description I can think of).  As you drag the
    visible-cache gets drawn back into the window at the newly exposed areas,
    and it also has a dithered appearance.  This bug occurs on both Mach and
    NT.  Furthermore it also occurs when applications linked with the NEXTSTEP
    3.3 version of MiscTableScroll run under OPENSTEP 4.x.  This leads me to
    believe that it is a bug in the window server itself.

- OPENSTEP 4.2 prerelease Objective-C++ compiler for both Mach and NT crashes
    whenever a message is sent to 'super' from within a category.  This comes
    up quite frequently.  I reported this bug to NeXT on 03/31/97 and it was
    registered with tracker #78005.  They fixed it in both the Mach and NT
    compilers and sent me the patched Mach compiler on 04/08/97, and the
    patched NT compiler on 04/21/97.  However, for some reason completely
    unknown to me, their fix only made it into the 4.2 final release compiler
    for Mach.  The 4.2 final release compiler for NT still contains the bug.
    Therefore I had to work around this problem in order to support the NT
    platform by reorganizing the code so as to avoid making such calls.

- OPENSTEP 4.2 Objective-C++ compiler for Mach and NT generates warnings about
    unused variables when the -Wall flag is used even though there is no
    sensible way to prevent them.  This problem comes up frequently, for
    instance: -(void)foo:(id)sender {}.  I worked around the problem by using
    -Wmost instead.

- OPENSTEP 4.2 pswrap generates unused 'pad' variables which result in useless
    and annoying compiler warnings.

- OPENSTEP 4.1 (gamma) Objective-C++ fails to define macro __PRETTY_FUNCTION__
    which is used by NSCAssert() and relatives.

- tops' "replacemethod" doesn't handle '&' correctly.  For instance, the
    conversion of getRow:col:ofCell: to getRow:column:ofCell: will fail if it
    is called in this fashion: [matrix getRow:&r col:&c ofCell:cell].  It will
    succeed, however, if it is called in this (less common) fashion: [matrix
    getRow:pr col:pc ofCell:cell]

- nextText connections are not converted automatically to nextKeyView.  Next
    should have patched their NSIBConnector class to perform this conversion
    automatically so that they show up in IB correctly (in addition to working
    correctly when loaded by an application).  I don't know what to do about
    this without having to do a bunch of extra programming, so I'll await word
    from NeXT about their final release.  [This appears to be fixed in 4.1.]

- OPENSTEP 4.1 & 4.2 fail to publish object_setInstanceVariable() (which is
    declared in the old Object.h) or an equivalent function.  This is used in
    -[MiscTableConnector establishConnection].  As a fix I manually declared
    the function.

- MiscBorderCell text is drawn in black rather than white.  TableCell text is
    drawn in black rather than -textColor/-selectedTextColor.  This is a known
    bug in OPENSTEP 4.1 & 4.2 (ref# 52511), -setupFieldEditorAttributes: does
    not get called for non-editable cells.  [I fixed this for now by
    subclassing from NSTextFieldCell and manually setting the text color.]


FIXED:
-----
v140.1
- After dragging a TableScroll to a new location on a window in Interface
    Builder, it appears to enter into a state where one can edit the
    underlying NSScrollView.  The scrollers become active and the TableView
    itself disappears.  It only exits this mode when a different object is
    clicked.  This bug affects MacOS/X Server DR2.  [I can no longer reproduce
    this.]
- Mouse cursor custom image is not working properly on MacOS/X Server DR2.
    For resizeable columns, the "resize" cursor only appears if moving the
    mouse from left to right.  The cursor never appears if moving from right
    to left.
- On MacOS/X Server DR2 and YellowBox DR2, connection inspector is not showing
    the item which action/doubleAction are connected to in any nib which is
    loaded by Interface Builder.  It does show new connections which are
    created during the current session, though.  This is true for both action
    and doubleAction.  The connection inspector works fine for OpenStep.
    [Problem was that IBClassData -actionsOfClass: no longer appends colon ":"
    to returned action names, as it did prior to DR2, yet the action name
    stored in the NSNibControlConnector includes the colon.  The connection
    inspector was doing a simple string comparision to locate the action in
    the action list.  Fixed by canonicalizing the names before comparing.]
- MiscTableScroll crashes during sorting now that notifications are properly
    exported with __declspec(dllexport).  [Problem was a bug in the
    Objective-C++ compiler for YellowBox and OpenStep 4.2 for Windows where it
    incorrectly places some variables in a .drectve section in the COFF object
    file instead of .rdata where they belong.  Since the linker discards the
    .drectve section before producing the final output, these variables were
    not getting initialized at all.  In this case, the static COMPARE_FUNC[]
    array was not being initialized in MiscTableScrollSort.M.  I worked around
    the problem by changing the way MiscTableTypes.h deals with exported
    symbols and also added MiscTableScrollSymbols.M which actually tells
    Windows which symbols should be exported from the DLL.]
- On MacOS/X Server, InterfaceBuilder complains that the MiscTableScroll
    connection inspector is making obsolete calls to -outletsOfClass: and
    -actionsOfClass:.  It suggests using -outletNamesOfClass: and
    -actionNamesOfClass: instead.  This warning does not appear on DR2.
    Evidence strongly indicates that the newer methods have the same input and
    return types, thus indicating that the methods were simply renamed in
    MacOS/X Server for clarity.  [Fixed by sending the new messages to
    InterfaceBuilder if it responds to them; otherwise send the old.  This is
    accomplished via -respondsToSelector:.]
- MiscTableView ignores user-specified scaling factor during printing.
    [Problem was that between NextStep and OpenStep, the AppKit engineers
    moved the scaling factor input field from the page layout panel to the
    print panel.  Under NextStep, it was possible to grab the scaling factor
    from the global PrintInfo object even before the print panel was launched,
    and this is exactly what MiscTableView did.  However, as of OpenStep, the
    scaling factor is not available until the print panel has been dismissed
    by the user.  MiscTableViewPrint.M had not been updated to account for
    this difference.  It was still assuming that the scaling factor was
    available prior to initiation of the print operation.]
