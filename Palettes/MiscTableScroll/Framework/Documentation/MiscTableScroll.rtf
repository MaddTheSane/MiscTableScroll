\pard\fs28\fi-1020\li1200\fc0\cf0 Class Description\

\fs16\fi0\li1360 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 This class provides a convenient and powerful user-interface object for displaying and manipulating tabular data.  The appearance and behavior is similar to NSTableView but is functionally superior.  Although it inherits from NSScrollView, the programmatic interface is similar to the NSMatrix class.\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Delegates and Notifications\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Both a 
\i delegate
\i0  and a 
\i dataDelegate
\i0  can be assigned to MiscTableScroll.  Internally MiscTableScroll treats the delegates identically.  The distinction between the two is conceptual and provides a convenient mechanism for programmers to cleanly compartmentalize specific object behavior.  Conceptually the 
\i dataDelegate
\i0  provides data to MiscTableScroll upon request with methods such as 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:intValueAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28  and its cousins.  The 
\i delegate
\i0 , on the other hand, responds to messages which control or observe the behavior of MiscTableScroll, such as 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:canEdit:atRow:column:
\f3\fs28  or 
\f4\fs24 -tableScrollSlotDragged:
\f3\fs28 .  This compartmentalization of functionality allows programmers to create a clean division between an object which strictly manages data from one which manages higher level behavior.  For most applications, however, it is generally sufficient to have a single object which handles all such functionality and assign it as the 
\i delegate
\i0 .  In very simple cases even the 
\i delegate
\i0  may be unnecessary.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 MiscTableScroll also posts notifications to the application's default notification center.  Any object may register to receive one or more of the notifications posted by MiscTableScroll by sending 
\f4\fs24 -addObserver:selector:name:object:
\f3\fs28  to the default notification center.  MiscTableScroll automatically registers its delegates to receive these notifications if the delegates respond to the appropriate messages.  For instance, if the 
\i delegate
\i0  responds to 
\f4\fs24 -tableScrollTextColorChanged:
\f3\fs28 , then it will automatically be registered to receive 
\f4\fs24 MiscTableScrollTextColorChangedNotification
\f3\fs28 .\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Standard delegate messages are only sent to one of the delegates even if both implement a particular message.  MiscTableScroll first checks the 
\i delegate
\i0  and then the 
\i dataDelegate
\i0 , and sends the message to the first object which responds to it.  Notifications, on the other hand, are sent to each delegate which responds to the appropriate notification message.\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Similarities between Rows and Columns -- Slots and Borders\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Rows and columns are treated equally wherever it is practical and desirable to do so.  Almost every action and option that is available for columns is also available for rows and vice versa.  
\i Slot
\i0  is the generic term for a single column or row.  
\i Border
\i0  is the generic term for row or column orientation.  
\i Size
\i0  is the generic term for width or height.  Most methods come in two flavors: a row/column specific flavor that uses 
\i row
\i0  or 
\i column
\i0  as part of the name; and a generic flavor that has a 
\i border
\i0  argument and (when needed) a 
\i slot
\i0  argument.  Here are some examples:\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Differences between Rows and Columns\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 There are some differences between rows and columns.  This object is designed to maximize the efficiency of displaying many rows of data.  Hence, it is faster to add and remove rows than columns.  You should set up all your columns in InterfaceBuilder, or while the table is empty, then add and remove rows afterwards.  Rows are cached for re-use with the 
\f4\fs24 -renewRows:
\f3\fs28  method.  This makes it very fast to change the contents of the table on a row-oriented basis.  Despite the row-oriented bias, column-oriented operations can be performed at any time; they will just be slower than the corresponding row-oriented operations.  This behavior is intrinsic to the implementation, it cannot be changed.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Cell-prototypes are only used for columns.  This behavior can only be changed by subclassing.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Selection in the body of a table is done on a row-wise basis.  This behavior can be changed programmatically via the 
\f4\fs24 -setSelectsByRows:
\f3\fs28  method.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 There are numerous default settings which differ between columns and rows.  Most of these options can be changed in InterfaceBuilder; all of them can be changed programmatically.  Here is a summary of the defaults which differ between rows and columns:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\li2100\fc0\cf0 \

\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Slot Sizing\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Uniform size is the simplest sizing mode.  When you set the uniform size of a border to any non-zero value, all slots in that border will have the same (uniform) size.  Setting the uniform size of a border to zero enables slots to have individual sizes.  By default, rows are uniform size, columns are not.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 If uniform sizing is not set for a border, the following sizing information is maintained for each slot in the border:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\f3\b0\fs28\li2160\fc0\cf0 target size\

adjusted size\
user-sizeable-flag\
autosize-flag\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Target size is the desired size for a particular slot.  Minimum and maximum sizes are the lower and upper bounds for the size of a slot.  Adjusted size is the final display size of the slot after all other factors have been taken into account.  When a slot is marked as user-sizeable, the user will be able to resize the slot (subject to further conditions described below).  The adjusted size of autosize slots will be increased if needed to prevent a "gap" from appearing when the table is smaller than the display region.  The flag values are mutually independent, but user-sizeable and autosize do not mix well.  They cause bizarre, counter-intuitive behavior on narrow tables in wide views.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Users resize columns by dragging the right-hand edge of the column's title cell to the desired width.  Likewise, users resize rows by dragging the bottom edge of the row's title cell to the desired height.  The cursor changes to a horizontal or vertical resize cursor whenever the cursor is over one of the resizing areas.  When users resize a slot, they are setting the target size for the slot on non-uniform-size borders.  On uniform-size borders, they are setting the new uniform-size for the border.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 All of the following conditions must be met to enable the user to resize a particular slot:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\f3\b0\fs28\fi-440\li2600\fc0\cf0 (a) The title cells must be displayed (
\f4\fs24 -border:setSlotTitlesOn:YES
\f3\fs28 )\
(b) The border in question must allow user-sizing of slots (
\f4\fs24 -border:setSizeableSlots:YES
\f3\fs28 )\
(c) The border must be uniform-size (
\f4\fs24 -setBorder:uniformSizeSlots:
\f3\fs28 ) or the slot in question must be user-sizeable  (
\f4\fs24 -border:setSlot:sizeable:YES
\f3\fs28 ).\
(d) There must be some room to grow or shrink between the slot's current adjusted size and the slot's minimum and maximum sizes.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\fs16\li2100\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 All of these conditions are met by default for new columns, unless you explicitly disable one of the global options for column sizing.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\fs16\li2100\fc0\cf0 \
\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Slot Dragging and Indexing -- Visual vs. Physical\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Dragging and sizing are independent of each other.  You can have borders that are not sizeable in any way, but are still draggable, and vice versa.  You can also have borders that are both draggable and sizeable, or neither draggable nor sizeable.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Users drag slots by dragging the title cells until the leading edge is over the desired new location and "dropping" the slot there.  For example, the left edge of the cell shows you where the column will end up when dragging a column to the left.  Likewise, the right edge is used when the column is dragged to the right.  This makes it possible to clearly see the new location without guessing.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Dragging must be enabled for that border.  By default, columns are dragged with an unmodified drag, and they are selected with a command-drag.  By default, rows are selected with an unmodified drag, and they are dragged with a command-drag.  By default, dragging is enabled for columns, but not for rows.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 If slot-dragging is enabled for a border then an internal mapping vector is maintained which translates the original physical position of the slot to its current visual position.  All programmer-interface methods and all delegate call-back methods use the original physical position of the slot so you can ignore the current visual ordering in your programs.  If you need or want to examine the current visual ordering, you can do so with the 
\f4\fs24 -border:slotPosition:
\f3\fs28  and 
\f4\fs24 -border:slotAtPosition:
\f3\fs28  methods.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\fs16\li2100\fc0\cf0 \
\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Keyboard Operations\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 MiscTableScroll provides keyboard control over almost all functions.  Keyboard equivalents are available for scrolling, selection, and performing actions (simulating double-click).  This class displays a dashed rectangle around the slot which is currently the focus of keyboard operations.  Display of the cursor can be disabled and re-enabled with calls to the methods 
\f4\fs24 -disableCursor
\f3\fs28  and 
\f4\fs24 -enableCursor
\f3\fs28 .\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 MiscTableScroll instances can be linked into the next-key-view chain just like all other Views.  This can be done directly in InterfaceBuilder
\f1 ä
\f3 , or programmatically via 
\f4\fs24 -nextKeyView
\f3\i\fs28 , 
\f4\i0\fs24 -setNextKeyView:
\f3\fs28 , and related functions.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\fs16\li2100\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 The keyboard 
\i cursor
\i0  can be moved with the standard arrow keys as well as the editing keys on the numeric keypad, including the page-up, page-down, home, and end keys -- as well as the 
\i real
\i0  page-up, page-down, home, and end on keyboards which actually supply these keys.  For functions which do not normally appear on any keyboard -- such as page-left and page-right -- modified arrow-keys can be used.  Please refer to the following table:\

\pard\tx2520\tx3720\tx4260\tx4800\tx5320\b0\fs24\fi-360\li2520\fc0\cf0 (³)	Modified actions are produced by holding down a modifier while typing the primary key.  Any of Shift, Control, or Alt can be used to produce a modified action -- and all have the same affect.  So, for instance, one can generate a page-left from any of ctrl-left-arrow, shift-left-arrow, or alt-left-arrow.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Keys which perform the 
\i select-slot
\i0  function simulate a single mouse-click.  Keys which perform 
\i perform-action
\i0  simulate a double mouse-click.  When performing a 
\i select-slot
\i0  via the keyboard, one can use the same modifier keys one uses when selecting via the mouse.  In other words, one can use shift-single-click to select multiple slots (one at a time) with the mouse.  Likewise one can use shift-space to select multiple slots (one at a time) with the keyboard.\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Selection Modes\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Three selection modes are supported: List, Highlight, and Radio.  Unlike NSMatrix, this class treats the different selection modes as uniformly as possible (see 
\i Mouse Tracking
\i0  below).  Methods such as 
\f4\fs24 -selectionMode
\f3\fs28  and 
\f4\fs24 -setSelectionMode:
\f3\fs28  allow direct control over the mode.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Methods such as 
\f4\fs24 -hasRowSelection
\f3\i\fs28 , 
\f4\i0\fs24 -numberOfSelectedRows
\f3\i\fs28 , 
\f4\i0\fs24 -rowIsSelected:
\f3\i\fs28 , 
\i0 as well as the border and slot variations allow selection querying, while methods such as 
\f4\fs24 -selectedRows
\f3\i\fs28 , 
\f4\i0\fs24 -selectedRowTags
\f3\i\fs28 , 
\f4\i0\fs24 -selectRows:
\f3\i\fs28 , 
\i0 and 
\f4\fs24 -selectRowsWithTags:
\f3\fs28  along with their variations allow batch-oriented selection modification.\

\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Mouse Tracking\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 The manner in which MiscTableScroll performs mouse-tracking is different from the manner in which NSMatrix does so.  This class gives the cells the opportunity to track the mouse in 
\i all
\i0  selection modes, whereas NSMatrix allows the cells to participate in mouse-tracking in all 
\i but
\i0  List mode.  NSMatrix make a special case of List mode, and in addition to the mouse-tracking difference it also modifies the cells' 
\i state
\i0  variables in this mode.  In all other modes NSMatrix allows the cell's mouse-tracking methods to manipulate the 
\i state
\i0  rather than doing so itself.  MiscTableScroll, on the other hand, treats all selection modes uniformly.  It always highlights a cell via its 
\i highlight
\i0  flag and 
\i never
\i0  alters the cell's 
\i state
\i0  -- instead it leaves alteration of 
\i state
\i0  to the cell's mouse-tracking methods.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\fs24 -mouseDown:
\f3\fs28 , this class gives the cell at the mouse-down location an opportunity to track the mouse by invoking its 
\f4\fs24 -trackMouse:inRect:ofView:untilMouseUp:
\f3\fs28  method.  That method normally tracks the mouse until either a mouse-up event in which case it returns YES, or until the mouse leaves the cell-frame in which case it returns NO.  If 
\f4\fs24 -trackMouse:inRect:ofView:untilMouseUp:
\f3\fs28  returns NO, then MiscTableScroll goes into its own modal-responder loops, continues tracking the mouse itself, and updates the selection appropriately until a mouse-up event.  Only the cell under the mouse-down event is given a chance to participate in tracking -- after that no other cells are offered the opportunity.\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Image Dragging\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 MiscTableScroll has built in support for dragging images directly out of cells using the standard AppKit dragging services.  Dragging is enabled by implementing a few simple methods in the delegate or dataDelegate.  Two required methods are 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:allowDragOperationAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28  and 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:preparePasteboard:forDragOperationAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28 .  Each method is passed a pointer to the MiscTableScroll and the cell's physical coordinates.  The first method gives the delegate or dataDelegate a chance to allow or veto the drag operation.  The second method is responsible for declaring types and, possibly, providing data for the pasteboard.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 A third delegate method 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:imageForDragOperationAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28  is required for non-image cells and optional for cells which contain an image.  This method allows the delegate or dataDelegate to supply an image for dragging.  If the cell from which dragging is taking place contains its own image, then this method need not be implemented or can return 0, in which case the cell's own image is used by default.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Other methods allow the delegate or dataDelegate to respond to the standard dragging source protocol methods.
\f0\b\fs16 \

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 As usual, when dealing with pasteboards, keep in mind that if a non-nil 
\i owner 
\i0 is specified
\i , 
\i0 the NSPasteboard will retain it.  Only upon the initiation of another dragging operation will the owner receive the 
\f4\fs24 -pasteboardChangedOwner:
\f3\fs28  message and be released.  Therefore the 
\i owner
\i0  needs to remain in a valid state, along with any necessary data, even after completion of the drag operation.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\fs16\li2100\fc0\cf0 \
\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Prototype Cells\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Each column maintains a prototype cell which is used when new rows are created.  When new rows are created, a 
\f4\fs24 -copyWithZone:
\f3\fs28  message is sent to the prototype cell for each column, and the new copy of the prototype cell is put into the new row.  This means that all prototype cells must implement the 
\f4\fs24 -copyWithZone:
\f3\fs28  method appropriately.  Generally this implies performing a 
\i deep
\i0  copy.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 The prototype cell can be one of the built-in types (text, icon, or button), it can be supplied by the delegate, or you can set it programmatically.  If you set a prototype cell programmatically, the MiscTableScroll object will retain the prototype cell, and will release it when it is finished with it.  If the delegate provides the prototype cell, the delegate retains ownership -- the MiscTableScroll object will neither retain nor release prototype cells provided by the delegate.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\fs16\li2100\fc0\cf0 \
\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Represented Objects\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\fs28\li1500 Represented objects are objects which slots and cells may represent.  By setting a represented object for a slot or cell you make an association between that object and the slot or cell in question.  For instance, you might have a table in which each row represents a font, and lists its name as well as associated information such as its style, italic angle, and underline position.  As a convenience you could set each row's represented object, using 
\f4\fs24 -setRow:representedObject:
\f3\fs28 , to the actual NSFont which is described by that row.  When a user selects one of the rows, the represented NSFont can be retrieved easily with 
\f4\fs24 -rowRepresentedObject:
\f3\fs28 .  A represented object can also be associated with the entire table.\

\f0\b\fs16\li1360 \

\f3\b0\fs28\li1500 The represented object functions as a more specific form of 
\i tag
\i0  that allows you to associate any object, not just an integer, with the table, slot, or cell.  This feature is solely for the developer's convenience.  MiscTableScroll itself does not access the represented object, except to retain, release, archive and restore it.\

\fs16\li2100 \
\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Cell Owner and Inherited Font and Color Attributes\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 The MiscTableScroll class implements an informal 
\i owner
\i0  protocol with the cells that it manages.  The MiscTableCell class implements the other side this informal protocol.  This protocol enables the cells to specify that they want to inherit their font and color attributes from their owner.  In this case, the owner is the MiscTableScroll object.  This makes it possible to propagate global 
\i default
\i0  font and color attributes to all such cells easily and efficiently.  At the same time, individual cells can use custom font and color attributes which will override the global default inherited values.  Cells that use the inherited values do not need to store copies of those inherited values.  Only cells that use custom values need to remember and store their own custom values.  See the documentation for the MiscTableCell class for more details.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\fs16\li2100\fc0\cf0 \
\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Cell Owner and Owner-Draw\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Another feature of the informal 
\i owner
\i0  protocol is a specialized notion of delegated drawing.  All cells that respond YES to the 
\f4\fs24 -ownerDraw
\f3\fs28  message are drawn by the MiscTableScroll rather than drawing themselves.  Since the MiscTableScroll object typically manages many cells with similar font and color attributes, the MiscTableScroll object can eliminate large amounts of redundant font and color setting PostScript code.  Likewise, contiguous cells with the same background colors have all of their backgrounds drawn with a single PostScript operator rather than several.  The built-in drawing mechanism also eliminates a lot of very expensive clipping path operations by simply not drawing partial characters that would be clipped.  (You can force the partially visible text to be displayed with the 
\f4\fs24 -setDrawsClippedText:YES
\f3\fs28  message.)  Any object used as a cell in an instance of MiscTableScroll object can take advantage of these facilities as long as the cell consists of plain (single font) text with a single (optional) image, and does not have borders or other drawing requirements.  This results in a very considerable improvement in drawing performance -- especially noticable on older, slower CPUs.  <FIXME: Owner-draw is currently restricted to cells containing 7-bit ASCII text.  See OPENSTEP-BUGS.txt>\

\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Lazy vs. Eager\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 In general, eager mode is much easier to use than lazy mode.  In eager mode, you can usually take advantage of the cells themselves to store the data that you are retrieving and displaying.  Even complex data types can be stored by allocating the record and assigning it as the 
\i represented object
\i0  for the row or cell.  By contrast, lazy mode forces you to manage all the storage yourself.  In eager mode, the MiscTableScroll object allocates and manages a dense matrix of cells, which you fill in with data as needed.  In lazy mode, the MiscTableScroll object does not manage any cells at all.  You are responsible for implementing 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:cellAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28  to provide the MiscTableScroll object with a cell whenever it needs one.  In lazy mode, you generally want to implement many of the 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:...ValueAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28  methods to improve performance.\

\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Usage Tips\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 For simple, flexible and maintainable access to the columns of the table scroll, you should declare an 
\b enum
\b0  which identifies the columns in the MiscTableScroll, for instance:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\b0\fs24\li2100 enum\
	\{\
	PHOTO_SLOT,\
	LAST_NAME_SLOT,\
	FIRST_NAME_SLOT,\
	AGE_SLOT\
	\};\

\f3\fs28 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\li1500\fc0\cf0 Then you use the enumeration identifiers whenever you need to specify a column.  Using an enumeration this way lets you add, remove and shuffle the slots just by updating the enum declaration, rather than searching through the code to find all the places that need to be fixed.  It also makes your code more readable.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 There are two standard patterns for putting the data into eager (non-lazy) MiscTableScroll objects: 
\f4\fs24 -renewRows:
\f3\fs28  and 
\f4\fs24 -addRow
\f3\fs28 .\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 -renewRows
\b0 :\
When you know the number of rows in advance, it is most efficient to use the 
\f4\fs24 -renewRows:
\f3\fs28  method to tell the MiscTableScroll object the number of rows that you will need.  Your code will usually be structured as follows:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\b0\fs24\li2100 int row;\
int const nrows = [dataSource count];\
\
[tableScroll 
\b renewRows
\b0 :nrows];\

\b for
\b0  (row = 0;  row < nrows;  row++)\
    \{\
    id item = [dataSource itemAtRow:row];\
    [tableScroll setRow:row representedObject:item];\
    [[tableScroll cellAtRow:row column:LAST_NAME_SLOT] setStringValue:[item lastName]];\
    [[tableScroll cellAtRow:row column:AGE_SLOT] setIntValue:[item age]];\
    //... and so on ...\
    \}\
\
if ([tableScroll autoSortRows])\
	[tableScroll sortRows];\

\f0\b\fs16\li1360 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 -addRow
\b0 \
When you do not know the final number of rows in advance, your code will usually be structured as follows:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\b0\fs24\li2100 id item;\
int row = 0;\
[tableScroll 
\b empty
\b0 ];\
\

\b while
\b0  ((item = [self getNextItem]) != 0)\
	\{\
	[tableScroll 
\b addRow
\b0 ];\
	[tableScroll setRow:row representedObject:item];\
	[[tableScroll cellAtRow:row column:LAST_NAME_SLOT] setStringValue:[item lastName]];\
	[[tableScroll cellAtRow:row column:AGE_SLOT] setIntValue:[item age]];\
	//... and so on ...\
	row++;\
	\}\
\
[tableScroll 
\b sizeToCells
\b0 ];\
\
if ([tableScroll autoSortRows])\
	[tableScroll sortRows];\

\f0\b\fs16\li1360 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 A common programming mistake is forgetting to call 
\f4\fs24 -sizeToCells
\f3\fs28 .  You must call 
\f4\fs24 -sizeToCells
\f3\fs28  after you have finished adding rows so that the MiscTableScroll can update the frames of its various subviews.  If you forget to call 
\f4\fs24 -sizeToCells
\f3\fs28 , the MiscTableScroll will appear to be empty when it is displayed.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\fs16\li2100\fc0\cf0 \
\

\f0\b\fs24\li1500 Smart Memory Management\

\f3\b0\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 The MiscTableScroll class implements 
\i smart
\i0  memory management.  It does not allocate support structures until and unless they are needed.  For example, since rows are uniform-size by default, the MiscTableScroll will not allocate the array of sizing-info structures until and unless you make the rows non-uniform size.  In a complimentary fashion, if you make the columns uniform size, the MiscTableScroll object will release the sizing-info array for the columns.  Similarly, custom titles must be stored in an array.  However, no other title-mode requires this array, and the array will only exist  for borders that have custom titles.  Likewise, the visual-to-physical mapping vector that supports user-draggable slots is only created when the first slot is actually moved.  Even if the draggable option is turned on, you will not incur the memory overhead until the option is used.  The net result of all this is that you only pay for the features that you use.  \

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 On the other hand, you do pay for the features that you do use.  These extra features exact a price in storage and cpu.  You should be careful about using them for rows when you expect thousands of rows.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 The MiscTableScroll class is designed to provide high-quality, consistent, flexible behavior to the user while supporting a wide range of load requirements -- from dozens of  rows to hundreds of thousands of rows.  Smart memory management is an important element in achieving that goal.\

\fs16\li1360 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 As of MacOS/X Server (DR2), MiscTableScroll and its supporting classes are accessible from Java.  The framework classes are exposed to Java with these names:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 A number of informal interfaces are also provided which define methods which the delegate or data-delegate may implement.  The interfaces are said to be 
\i informal
\i0  since the delegate need only implement the methods which it requires.  Provided that the implementations of these methods use the correct signatures, they will be dispatched as needed by MiscTableScroll.  There is no need for the delegate to explicitly state, in Java terminology, that it 
\i implements
\i0  an interface.  The methods defined in these interfaces are described later in this document in the sections 
\i Methods Implemented by the Delegate
\i0 ,
\i  Delegate Methods for Dragging Source Operations
\i0 , and 
\i Methods Implemented by Cell Subclasses
\i0 .  The exposed interfaces are:\

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Some Objective-C methods, such as 
\f4\fs24 -getRow:column:forPoint:
\f3\fs28  and 
\f4\fs24 -getRow:column:ofCell:
\f3\fs28  return row and column values by reference.  Since Java does not support the return of multiple values from a single method invocation, the Java counterparts 
\f4\fs24 locationForPoint()
\f3\fs28  and 
\f4\fs24 locationOfCell()
\f3\fs28  return a simple wrapper object, 
\f4\fs24 org.misckit.yellow.application.TableScroll.Location
\f3\fs28 , which defines two public integer fields, 
\f4\fs24 row
\f3\fs28  and 
\f4\fs24 column
\f3\fs28 .  The actual definition of 
\f4\fs24 Location
\f3\fs28  is presented later in the 
\i Constants and Defined Classes
\i0  section.  Constants which are exported by the framework, such as 
\f4\fs24 TableScrollSlotDraggedNotification
\f3\fs28 , 
\f4\fs24 MAX_PIXELS_SIZE
\f3\fs28 , and 
\f4\fs24 BORDER_COLUMN
\f3\fs28 , are also presented in that section.\

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 In general, the names of Java methods are identical or nearly identical to their Objective-C counterparts, but with extra punctuation stripped away.  Here are some examples:\

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 The resources which allow MiscTableScroll to be accessed from Java are located within the MiscTableScroll framework.  In particular, these resources consist of a dynamically loaded library, 
\f4\fs24 MiscTableScrollJava
\f3\fs28 , and the compiled Java byte-code (the .
\f4\fs24 class
\f3\fs28  files).  To use MiscTableScroll from Java in a project, it is necessary to provide the correct search path to ensure that these resources can be properly located within the framework at both compilation time and execution time.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Follow these steps to use MiscTableScroll in a Java project:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx2380\tx2860\tx3240\f3\b0\fs28\fi-280\li2380\fc0\cf0 1.	Add 
\f4\fs24 MiscTableScroll.framework
\f3\fs28  to the project's 
\i Framework
\i0  list.\
2.	Add the 
\f4\fs24 MiscTableScrollJava
\f3\fs28  dynamically linked library to the project's 
\i Libraries
\i0  list.\
3. Add the library's path to the project's 
\i Library Search Order
\i0  list.\
4.	In 
\f4\fs24 Makefile.preamble
\f3\fs28 , ensure that the definition of 
\f4\fs24 CLASSPATH
\f3\fs28  includes the 
\f4\fs24 Resources/Java
\f3\fs28  directory within the MiscTableScroll framework.\
5.	Add a 
\f4\fs24 CustomInfo.plist
\f3\fs28  file to the project which defines configuration options which allow the application to locate the compiled Java byte-code and dynamically linked library at execution time, as discussed below.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 The dynamically linked library, which is added to the project in step 2, is located within the framework's 
\f4\fs24 Resource
\f3\fs28  directory.  On Mach it is named 
\f4\fs24\fc1\cf1 libMiscTableScrollJava.dylib
\f3\fs28\fc0\cf0 .  On Microsoft Windows it is named 
\f4\fs24\fc1\cf1 MiscTableScrollJava.lib
\f3\fs28\fc0\cf0 .  On Windows, an additional file, 
\f4\fs24\fc1\cf1 MiscTableScrollJava.dll
\f3\fs28\fc0\cf0  is also installed in the standard 
\f4\fs24\fc1\cf1 Excutables
\f3\fs28\fc0\cf0  directory along with other framework executable files.  The 
\f4\fs24\fc1\cf1 Executables
\f3\fs28\fc0\cf0  directory must be mentioned in the Windows 
\f4\fs24\fc1\cf1 PATH
\f3\fs28\fc0\cf0  environment variable.  At minimum, when adding entries to the project's 
\i Library Search Order
\i0  in step 3, these paths should probably be included:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\b0\fs24\fi-240\li2340 $(NEXT_ROOT)/$(LOCAL_LIBRARY_DIR)/Frameworks/MiscTableScroll.framework/Resources\
$(NEXT_ROOT)/Network/Library/Frameworks/MiscTableScroll.framework/Resources\

\f0\b\fs16\fi0\li1360 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 The Java compiler needs to know the location of the compiled byte-code (.
\f4\fs24 class
\f3\fs28  files) when the project is built.  The 
\f4\fs24 CLASSPATH
\f3\fs28  environment variable can be used to convey this information to the Java compiler.  A convenient way to ensure that 
\f4\fs24 CLASSPATH
\f3\fs28  includes the path to MiscTableScroll's byte-code is to insert the following code into the project's 
\f4\fs24 Makefile.preamble
\f3\fs28 , as instructed in step 4.  This sample code should work for the most common cases where MiscTableScroll is installed in one of the standard locations.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\b0\fs24\li2100 #------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
# Makefile.preamble\
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
# Ensure that the Java directory within the MiscTableScroll framework is\
# included in the class-path passed to the Java compiler.\

CLASSPATH = $(subst $(THINAIR) $(THINAIR),:,$(strip \\\
    $(NEXT_ROOT)/$(LOCAL_LIBRARY_DIR)/Frameworks/MiscTableScroll.framework/Resources/Java \\\

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 The 
\f4\fs24 CustomInfo.plist
\f3\fs28 , which is added in step 5, is used to address a number of Java issues relevant at execution time.  When the project is built, the 
\f4\fs24 CustomInfo.plist
\f3\fs28  file is automatically merged into the generated 
\f4\fs24 Info.plist
\f3\fs28  file which is placed into the application wrapper.  Among other uses, 
\f4\fs24 Info.plist
\f3\fs28  is loaded into the running application early during its execution and provides a convenient place to put configuration options which affect the application's behavior.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 When the compiled application is executed, the Java engine must be able to locate the compiled MiscTableScroll byte-code (.
\f4\fs24 class
\f3\fs28  files).  To ensure that the engine can locate the byte-code, add an 
\f4\fs24 NSJavaUserPath
\f3\fs28  entry to 
\f4\fs24 CustomInfo.plist
\f3\fs28  which specifies the location of the MiscTableScroll Java resources.  Here is a definition of 
\f4\fs24 NSJavaUserPath
\f3\fs28  for use in 
\f4\fs24 CustomInfo.plist
\f3\fs28  which works in most cases when MiscTableScroll is installed in one of the standard locations:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\b0\fs24\li2100 NSJavaUserPath = (\
    /Local/Library/Frameworks/MiscTableScroll.framework/Resources/Java,\
    /Apple/Local/Library/Frameworks/MiscTableScroll.framework/Resources/Java,\
    /Network/Library/Frameworks/MiscTableScroll.framework/Resources/Java\
    );\

\f0\b\fs16\li1360 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Likewise, the Java engine must be able to locate the dynamically linked library at execution time.  The library path specified in step 3 provides the linker with the means to locate the library at build time, however the Java engine does not have access to this information when the application is finally executed.  To ensure that the Java engine can locate the library as well, an 
\f4\fs24 NSJavaLibraryPath
\f3\fs28  entry may be added to 
\f4\fs24 CustomInfo.plist
\f3\fs28 .  Here is a definition of 
\f4\fs24 NSJavaLibraryPath
\f3\fs28  which works in most cases:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\b0\fs24\li2100 NSJavaLibraryPath = (\
    /Local/Library/Frameworks/MiscTableScroll.framework/Resources,\
    /Network/Library/Frameworks/MiscTableScroll.framework/Resources\
    );\

\f0\b\fs16\li1360 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 As a convenience, MiscTableScroll can be configured to automatically update the library search path instead of manually specifying it via 
\f4\fs24 NSJavaLibraryPath
\f3\fs28 .  To do so, add an entry for 
\f4\fs24 MiscTableScrollAddLibrarySearchPaths
\f3\fs28  with a value of 
\f4\fs24 Yes
\f3\fs28  to 
\f4\fs24 CustomInfo.plist
\f3\fs28 .  MiscTableScroll will then automatically update the library search path to include all standard 
\i library
\i0  directories as returned by a call to 
\f4\fs24 NSPathUtilities.searchPathForDirectoriesInDomains()
\f3\fs28 .  The default value of 
\f4\fs24 MiscTableScrollAddLibrarySearchPaths
\f3\fs28  is 
\f4\fs24 No
\f3\fs28 .  To enable this option in 
\f4\fs24 CustomInfo.plist
\f3\fs28 , specify:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\b0\fs24\li2100 MiscTableScrollAddLibrarySearchPaths = Yes;\

\f0\b\fs16\li1360 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Finally, a restriction in the Objective-C to Java bridge prevents Java programs from correctly accessing MiscTableScroll when the default Java security manager is in use.  To work around this limitation, it is necessary to install the 
\f4\fs24 NullSecurityManager
\f3\fs28  early in the application's execution.  It is typically sufficient to perform this task in a static initializer within the application's controlling Java class.  For instance:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\b0\fs24\li2100 static \{\
	try \{\
		com.apple.security.NullSecurityManager.installSystemSecurityManager();\
	\} catch (Exception e) \{\}\
\}\

\f0\b\fs16\li1360 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 As a convenience, MiscTableScroll can be configured to automatically install the 
\f4\fs24 NullSecurityManager
\f3\fs28  on the application's behalf, instead of having to do so manually.  To enable this option, add an entry for 
\f4\fs24 MiscTableScrollUseNullSecurityManager
\f3\fs28  with a value of 
\f4\fs24 Yes
\f3\fs28  to 
\f4\fs24 CustomInfo.plist
\f3\fs28 .  Its default value is 
\f4\fs24 No
\f3\fs28 .\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\b0\fs24\li2100 MiscTableScrollUseNullSecurityManager = Yes;\

\f0\b\fs16\li1360 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 For most projects the following sample 
\f4\fs24 CustomInfo.plist
\f3\fs28  should be sufficient to enable use of MiscTableScroll from Java.  It can be copied, verbatim, into the project's 
\f4\fs24 CustomInfo.plist
\f3\fs28  file.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\f4\b0\fs24\li2100 // CustomInfo.plist\

MiscTableScrollUseNullSecurityManager = Yes;\
MiscTableScrollAddLibrarySearchPaths = Yes;\

\fs16\li1360 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 The only exception currently raised by MiscTableScroll is NSInternalInconsistencyException.  This exception is raised when MiscTableScroll detects an internal inconsistency.  This is typically indicative of a bug within this class.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\f0\b\fs16\li1360\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\f3\b0\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 This exception is also currently raised when an out-of-range slot index is passed as an argument to a method which can not sensibly handle the bad index.  For instance, there is no sensible value which 
\f4\fs24 -rowTag:
\f3\fs28  can return when given a bad index, hence it raises an exception.  On the other hand no exception is raised by 
\f4\fs24 -selectRow:
\f3\fs28  since it can simply ignore the bad index.  <FIXME: In the future such methods will raise a more suitable exception, such as NSRangeException.>\

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Appends a new row to the table.  If you know how many rows you will need in advance, you should use 
\f4\fs24 -renewRows:
\f3\fs28  instead; it will be faster.  If you do not know the number of rows in advance, use this method.  This method is faster than 
\f4\fs24 -insertColumn:
\f3\fs28 .  Internally, the table pre-allocates rows with a geometric growth pattern so there are only a logarithmic number of allocations.  See 
\b Usage Tips
\b0  in the introduction for a more complete discussion.  Equivalent to: 
\f4\fs24 -addSlot:MISC_ROW_BORDER

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\li1500\fc0\cf0 This method does no drawing, nor does it update the frames of the various subviews.  (This enhances performance when adding hundreds or thousands of rows.)  After you have finished adding rows, you must call 
\f4\fs24 -sizeToCells
\f3\fs28  so that the MiscTableScroll can update the frames of the various subviews.\

\f3\fs28 ) into the cell's tag, and format the string value any way you wish.  The slot will sort correctly regardless of the display format.  It is also useful for slots that hold keywords from an ordered set of values, like the following enumeration:\

\i0 is the 
\i physical
\i0  (original) position of a slot.    The elements of 
\i v
\i0  are each an NSNumber in Objective-C, and a java.lang.Integer in Java.  The slots will be compared in the order that they appear in 
\i v
\i0 .  Use the one's complement (bitwise negation with the tilde, `~', operator) to reverse the sort direction (ascending / descending) of a slot.  The current 
\i visual
\i0  slot order is used by default; use this method to specify a different ordering.  This method turns off auto-sort for the other border.  That is, setting a 
\i slotSortVector
\i0  for the columns turns off auto-sort for the rows.  The auto-sort facility automatically sorts the table whenever a slot is dragged, so setting a slot sort vector invalidates the premise on which auto-sort works.\

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Re-sorts a single slot.  This method can be used to restore the sort order after a single slot has been added or changed in such a way that it might not be in the correct sort position.  The results are unpredictable if the other slots are not already sorted.  Returns YES if the slot sorted to a new visual location, otherwise returns NO.\

\i0  to the physical index of the column that should be searched,  otherwise returns NO.  To enable incremental search via this function, autoSortRows must be YES; the first sorting column must be string-based (stringValue or title); and there cannot be a custom sort function for the column.  This method works appropriately for normal tables, as long as autoSortRows is turned on.  Whenever the user drags a string-based column to the first position, incremental search will be enabled.  Non-sorting (skip) columns are ignored.  You can override this behavior by implementing the 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:getIncrementalSearchColumn:
\f3\fs28  method in your delegate.\

\i0  must be the key-down event that invoked incremental searching.  
\i Column
\i0  must be the column that will be searched.  The table must be sorted in

\i col
\i0  must be string-based (
\f4\fs24 -stringValue
\f3\fs28  or 
\f4\fs24 -title
\f3\fs28 ).  
\i Column
\i0  cannot have a custom sort function.  You are responsible for ensuring that the table is sorted in 
\i column
\i0  order.  This method runs a modal event loop, processing keystrokes and scrolling the table appropriately.  Returns YES if 
\i column
\i0  was acceptable and 
\i event
\i0  was processed.  Returns NO if 
\i column
\i0  failed any of the tests mentioned.\

\f4\fs24 -canEdit:atRow:column:
\f3\fs28 .  When 
\i forward
\i0  is NO, this method returns the coordinates of the nearest previous cell that is editable.  The search order is based on the visual order of slots in the MiscTableScroll.  Normally this method is used by assigning the physical coordinates of the cell that is currently being edited to 
\i row
\i0  and 
\i col
\i0 .  The method then searches for the next/previous cell that is editable and updates the values of 
\i row
\i0  and 
\i col
\i0  to the coordinates of the next/previous editable cell.  This method is used in the 
\f4\fs24 -textDidEndEditing:
\f3\fs28  method to find the next / previous cell when the user presses TAB / SHIFT-TAB to terminate cell editing. \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Returns YES if the mouse is currently being tracked by a cell, else NO.  Technically, this method returns YES after the cell which will track the mouse has been highlighted, and NO after it has been unhighlighted.  The cell which is tracking the mouse can be accessed via 
\f4\fs24 -clickedCell
\f3\fs28 , 
\f4\fs24 -clickedColumn
\f3\fs28 , or 
\f4\fs24 -clickedRow
\f3\fs28 .  Although setting a Cell's 
\i highlight
\i0  flag is sufficient during mouse tracking in eager-mode, it is not sufficient in lazy-mode.  Therefore MiscTableScroll uses this method in lazy-mode to determine when a cell should be drawn highlighted.  You should rarely need to call this method, though it might be useful in subclasses.\

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 This method precomputes the sorting information needed by the sorting methods.  If you call any of the sorting methods that accept an 
\f4\fs24 info:
\f3\fs28  argument, you must initialize the 
\i sortInfo
\i0  structure by calling this method first.  After you have finished using the 
\i sortInfo
\i0  structure, you must reclaim the storage by passing the 
\i sortInfo
\i0  structure to 
\f4\fs24 -sortInfoDone:
\f3\fs28 .  NOTE: The 
\i sortInfo
\i0  structure stores the current sorting information for the table.  Any changes made to the sorting environment after the 
\i sortInfo
\i0  structure has been initialized will not affect the contents of the 
\i sortInfo
\i0  structure, and therefore will not affect comparisons made using the 
\i sortInfo
\i0  structure.  Actions that affect the sorting environment include: rearranging columns/rows, installing a slotSortVector, installing a custom slot comparison function, changing the sort-type or sort-direction of a slot.  Actions which alter the structure of the "other" border (like removing columns/rows) can potentially cause catastrophic failures.\

\f3\fs28  to the default notification center, sorts the data if auto-sorting is enabled, and finally posts

\i0 ,

\i0 , or

\i0 caused the editing to end.  If the cause was return, then the action is sent to the target, else if it was tab or shift-tab, then 
\f4\fs24 -getNext:editRow:column:
\f3\fs28  is invoked to determine which cell should be edited next and editing is initiated for that cell using

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Returns the value of sending a 
\f4\fs24 -title
\f3\fs28  message to the cell at 
\i row
\i0 , 
\i col
\i0 .  If the table is lazy, the 
\i delegate
\i0 , and then the 
\i dataDelegate
\i0  are given the opportunity to reply to the 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:titleAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28  message.  This gives lazy tables an opportunity to return this information directly, without the overhead of preparing and formatting a cell.  If the table is not lazy, or the 
\i delegate
\i0  and 
\i dataDelegate
\i0  do not respond to the 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:titleAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28  message, then the cell is retrieved via 
\f4\fs24 -cellAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28 .  If the cell responds to the 
\f4\fs24 -title
\f3\fs28  message, that value is returned; otherwise, zero (a NULL pointer) is returned.  NOTE: NSButtonCell implements the 
\f4\fs24 -stringValue
\f3\fs28  message by formatting the integer value of its state as a string.  To retrieve the text label displayed on the button, you must use the 
\f4\fs24 -title
\f3\fs28  method.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\fs16\li2100\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 Sorting retrieves the values of two cells from the same slot to compare them.  In eager mode, it is sufficient to perform the comparison in a manner similar to this:\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\fs16\li2100\fc0\cf0 \

\f2\fs20\li1800 [[cell1 stringValue] isEqualToString:[cell2 stringValue]]
\f3\fs28 \

\fs16\li2100 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 However, it is common for lazy-mode delegates to simply recycle a single cell to handle the 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:cellAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28  message.  In that case, the first value is no longer valid when the second value is retrieved, so the MiscTableScroll object needs to copy the first value before retrieving the second value.  By default, the MiscTableScroll object makes the pessimistic (but safe) assumption that it needs to copy the first string value before retrieving the second string value.  Sophisticated delegates can eliminate this copy operation if they provide at least two buffers for each slot, or if they implement the string retrieval methods (
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:stringValueAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28  and/or 
\f4\fs24 -tableScroll:titleAtRow:column:
\f3\fs28 ) in a way that makes it possible to retrieve a second string value from the same slot without invalidating the previous string value retrieved from that slot.\

\pard\tx2480\tx2860\tx3240\fs16\li2100\fc0\cf0 \

\pard\tx3600\tx3980\tx4340\fs28\li1500\fc0\cf0 If the value returned is greater than or equal to two (2), the string values will not be copied.\

\i0  to decide whether or not editing should begin.  If the 
\i delegate
\i0  returns YES, an editing session will begin for the cell.  If the

\i0  returns NO, no editing session will begin.  This message is tested with the 
\i delegate
\i0 ,

\i0  and the cell itself.  The first object that responds to the message decides the outcome.  If none of those objects respond to the message, the default behavior will allow editing only on a double-click or keyboard event, and only if the cell is both editable and enabled.\
