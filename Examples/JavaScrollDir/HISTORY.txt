v1.1 1999/06/14 15:35 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Created.  This project is based on ScrollDir v35.1; translated to Java.
    Worked around problem with message being sent to freed object when run on
	MacOS/X Server.  This problem did not occur on DR2.  It turns out that
	the behavior of the Objective-C to Java bridge changed with regards to
	weakly-referenced pure-Java objects.  Such objects are freed
	automatically in MacOS/X Server, but were not freed in DR2.  DirWindow
	is just such an object, and was thus being freed unexpectedly.  The
	problem was fixed by creating a strong reference to each DirWindow by
	converting the list of active DirWindow objects, OPEN_DIRS, from a
	Java Vector to an NSArray.  The NSArray retains each DirWindow on the
	Objective-C side, thus creating a strong reference.
