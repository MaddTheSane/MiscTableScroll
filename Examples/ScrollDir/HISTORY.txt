v35 1999/06/25 08:13 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Synchronized with ScrollDir v35.1 for OpenStep.
    Renamed Directory menu's New item to Open.
    Renamed Directory menu's Save item to Export.
    Added File menu.  Moved Open & Delete items to this menu.
    Reorganized DirWindow.nib layout to match OpenStep counterpart.
    Renamed DirController's -new: to -openDirectory:.
    Renamed DirWindow's -open: to -openSelected:.
    Renamed DirWindow's -save: to -export:.
    Fixed spelling error in SD_PageLayout.nib: Botom -> Bottom.
    Updated copyrignt on Info panel.
    Updated copyright and contact information in README.
    The user is now prompted for confirmation before deleting files via the
	File/Delete menu item.
    Moved nib files to English.lproj to support localization.
    Added unpack.sh to simplify unpacking a project with subdirectories.
    Added copyright notice to ScrollDir_main.m.
    PB.project no longer generates main() file upon save.
    Removed unused +[SD_PageLayout launch:].
    Fixed comments in SD_PageLayout.{h|m}.
    Now correctly uses -tableScroll:changeFont:to: rather than
	-tableScroll:fontChangedFrom:to: to note user instigated font change.
    For naming consistency, renamed -didClick: to -scrollClick: and
	-didDoubleClick: to -scrollDoubleClick: in DirWindow.  This is more
	consistent with other names such as -lockClick:.
    Removed Copy Font, Paste Font, Underline, Superscript, Subscript, and
	Unscript from Font menu since they made no sense in this context.
    Cleaned up Makefile.preamble and Makefile.postamble files.  Added
	copyright notices.
    Ported back to NextStep 3.2.  Had to add -I & -L directives to
	OTHER_CFLAGS & OTHER_LDFLAGS in Makefile.preamble since the 3.2
	makefiles do not recognize these directives when specified via
	NextStep 3.3's Project Builder.

    Added -tableScrollIgnoreModifierKeysWhileDragging:, which returns NO.

    Added /LocalDeveloper/Libraries to library paths.
    Moved -Wwrite-strings from Makefile.preamble into PB.project.
    Removed hard-coded names from 'relink' target in Makefile.postamble.
    Worked around AppKit but where the Cell class blindly allocates ClipViews
	from transient zones and caches them for later re-use.

    * DirWindow.m
    * Makefile
    * Makefile.{preamble|postamble}

v30 1997/06/10 05:09 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Synchronized with ScrollDir v29.4 for OPENSTEP.
    Restructured DirWindow.m to parallel LazyScrollDir counterpart.
    Now sets window title with -setTitleAsFilename:.
    Fixed bug: Wasn't taking "sticky bit" on directories into account when
	computing whether file could be renamed.
    No longer misleadingly stat()'s the file which a soft-link points at.
    Ditched the Message slot.

    Changed Files:
    * DirWindow.{m|nib}

v27 1996/12/30 17:02 EST zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Now works with MiscTableScroll v113.
    Added text-cell editing to rename files.
    Also added preliminary printing.

v26 1996/10/07 09:39 EDT zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Now works with MiscTableScroll v109.
    Added Save command for exporting contents of TableScroll.

v25 1996/10/07 09:38 EDT zarnuk@zarnuk.com

    Responds to new user slot-sort-reversed message.

v24 1996/02/17 09:00 EST zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Fixed includes since MiscTableScroll.h no longer includes MiscIntList.h

v23 1996/02/09 01:00 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Replaced NameCache's custom hash table with NeXT's HashTable.
    Info panel will now load README.rtf or README.rtfd.
    Updated README.

v22 1996/02/01 04:15 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Added Defaults.[mh] as simple front-end to NeXT defaults.
    The following are now saved and restored via NeXT defaults:
	Auto-sort
	Column order
	Column widths
	Font
	Highlight directories
	Show hidden
	Window color
	Window size
    Added a README.rtf file which explains what this example demonstrates.
    Added an Info panel that displays the README.rtf file.

v21 1996/01/17 05:30 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Fixed warning that showed up when compiling for debug.  Had to replace
	(int const) with #define for array size.

v20 1996/01/17 04:30 EST zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Added NameCache code from LazyScrollDir.  Small performance improvement.
	Asking the Workspace for the icons is the real time killer.

v19 1996/01/17 02:00 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Removed mcgh2misc conversions scripts since the one in the palette
	directory now handles the example directories automatically.

v18 1996/01/16 01:00 EST zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Fixed bug: Now calls -setImage:0 before freeing the image that was
	in the cell before.  This was the crasher that was generating the
	message: "objc: FREE(id): message getSize: sent to freed object"
	The bug was reproducible:
	(1) Create a non-empty selection.
	(2) Click on the close box.
	At step #2, -[DirWindow free] called -freeImages, which freed all the
	images, but left pointers to the freed images in the icon cells, then
	it called -[Window free] which ultimately called -[MiscTableScroll
	free] while it was freeing the views on the window...  This invoked
	-emptyAndFreeCells, which called -empty, which called -renewRows:0,
	which called -clearSelection, which called -selectionChanged, which
	called -reflectSelection, which called -[MiscTableView
	reflectSelection] which tried to draw the cells in their unhighlighted
	state.  (All this, despite the fact that the window had been closed,
	and was, in fact, about to be freed.)

v17 1996/01/08 21:00 EST zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Fixed bug: Was not closing directory after scanning it.
    Fixed bug: Was not freeing images.

v16 1995/10/20 13:30 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Added missing implementation for -new:.  Now it uses the OpenPanel to
	select the directory you want to view.

v15 1995/10/20 04:30 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Prepared for inclusion in MiscKit.
    Added mcgh2misc conversion scripts.
    Fixed Makefile.preamble's -I and -L flags to work with MiscKit also.
    Added libMiscTableScroll.a directly to the Project so that Project Builder
	handles it instead of manually adding it to the Makefile.preamble.
    Added an application icon.
    Localized nibs.

v14 1995/10/19 02:30 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Converted nib's TableScroll class version number from 3 to 0.  I changed
	the version number in TableScroll itself some time ago and converted
	this nib, but apparently I forgot to cut a new version of ScrollDir.
	(So essentially this nib could not be loaded in IB, or elsewhere.)
    Updated DirWindow.m to reflect fact that -cellAt:: methods in TableScroll
	now return (id) instead of (Cell*).

v13 1995/10/01 17:15 EDT zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Directory highlight now extends to include the "message" column.
    Now suppresses display while re-loading the directory.

v12 1995/10/01 15:30 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Can now drag color swatches into window.
    Added "highlight dirs" switch which sets the color on cells which show
	directories.  This was done to test individual cell colors to make
	sure that they don't get changed when a swatch is dropped on the
	window.

v11 1995/09/26 04:00 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Now imports newly public header <MiscTableCell.h>.  Old MiscTableCell
	protocol went away.

v10 1995/09/26 04:00 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    "Change Dir" button is now enabled only when a single directory is
	selected.
