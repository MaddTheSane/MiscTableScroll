v19 1999/06/29 08:20 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Synchronized with LazyScrollDir v19.1 for OpenStep.
    Renamed Directory menu's New item to Open.
    Renamed Directory menu's Save item to Export.
    Added File menu.  Moved Open & Delete items to this menu.
    Reorganized DirWindow.nib layout to match OpenStep counterpart.
    Renamed DirController's -new: to -openDirectory:.
    Renamed DirWindow's -open: to -openSelected:.
    Renamed DirWindow's -save: to -export:.
    Fixed spelling error in SD_PageLayout.nib: Botom -> Bottom.
    Updated copyrignt on Info panel.
    Updated copyright and contact information in README.
    The user is now prompted for confirmation before deleting files via the
	File/Delete menu item.
    Moved nib files to English.lproj to support localization.
    Added unpack.sh to simplify unpacking a project with subdirectories.
    Added copyright notice to LazyScrollDir_main.m.
    PB.project no longer generates main() file upon save.
    Removed unused +[SD_PageLayout launch:].
    Fixed comments in SD_PageLayout.{h|m}.
    Now correctly uses -tableScroll:changeFont:to: rather than
	-tableScroll:fontChangedFrom:to: to note user instigated font change.
    For naming consistency, renamed -didClick: to -scrollClick: and
	-didDoubleClick: to -scrollDoubleClick: in DirWindow.  This is more
	consistent with other names such as -lockClick:.
    Removed Copy Font, Paste Font, Underline, Superscript, Subscript, and
	Unscript from Font menu since they made no sense in this context.
    Cleaned up Makefile.preamble and Makefile.postamble files.  Added
	copyright notices.
    Ported back to NextStep 3.2.  Had to add -I & -L directives to
	OTHER_CFLAGS & OTHER_LDFLAGS in Makefile.preamble since the 3.2
	makefiles do not recognize these directives when specified via
	NextStep 3.3's Project Builder.

    Changed Files:
    * DirController.{h|m}
    * DirWindows.{h|m|nib}

    * Makefile

v18 1998/03/23 23:38 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com

    Added -tableScrollIgnoreModifierKeysWhileDragging:, which returns NO.
    Updated copyright notices on user interface items.
    Added a "Printing" section to the README.
    Added license and contact information to the README.
    Fixed v1 bug: Wasn't respecting highlighted-text color.  Problem was that

    * Info.nib
    * Makefile

    Moved -Wwrite-strings from Makefile.preamble into PB.project.
    Removed hard-coded names from 'relink' target in Makefile.postamble.
    Worked around AppKit but where the Cell class blindly allocates ClipViews
	from transient zones and caches them for later re-use.
    Fixed broken wording in README.

    Changed Files:
    * DirWindow.m
    * Makefile
    * Makefile.{preamble|postamble}

v15 1997/06/10 04:51 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Synchonized with ScrollDir v30 for NEXTSTEP.
    Now sets window title with -setTitleAsFilename:.
    Fixed bug: Wasn't taking "sticky bit" on directories into account when
	computing whether file could be renamed.
    No longer misleadingly stat()'s the file which a soft-link points at.
    Ditched the Message slot.

    Changed Files:
    * DirArray.{h|m}
    * DirWindow.{h|m|nib}
    * pack.sh
    * pack_binaries.sh
    * unpack_binaries.sh

v14 1997/03/22 23:36 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Lock column in DirWindow.nib was incorrectly sizeable and auto-sizing.
    SD_PageLayout.{h|m} RCS files were missing.

    Fixed wording on Info panel.
    Updated all the copyrights to include 1997 (including Info.nib).
    Unified formatting.
    Updated documentation to reflect the new features.
    Renamed: "Update" -> "Refresh"
    Checked all of the files into RCS.
    Added pack and unpack scripts.
    Added text-cell editing to rename files.
    Also added preliminary printing.

    Changed Files:
    * Everything

v12 1996/10/07 10:41 EDT zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Now works with MiscTableScroll v109.
    Added Save command for exporting contents of TableScroll.

v11 1996/10/07 10:32 EDT zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Now works with MiscTableScroll v105.
    Responds to new slot-sort-reversed message.
    Added row-titles for purposes of testing row-wise dragging.  This is not
	very nice or useful for the user interface, but is extremely useful
	for testing TableScroll.  (Perhaps we should add a button to toggle
	this).
    v10 was created by sunshine.  It incorporated many experimental features,
	but was abandoned.  v11 is a direct descendent of v9.

v9 1996/02/15 06:00 EST zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Fixed includes since MiscTableScroll.h no longer includes MiscIntList.h

v8 1996/02/09 01:00 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Replaced NameCache's custom hash table with NeXT's HashTable.
    Info panel will now load README.rtf or README.rtfd.
    DirArray is now an Objective-C class rather than kludgy C.
    Updated README.

v7 1996/02/01 04:15 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Added Defaults.[mh] as a simple front-end to NeXT defaults.
    The following are now saved and restored via NeXT defaults:
	Auto-sort
	Column order
	Column widths
	Font
	Highlight directories
	Show hidden
	Window color
	Window size
    Fixed bug which caused file icons of "/" directory to be incorrect.  The
	filename sent to the Workspace to retrieve the icons lacked a
	null-terminator.
    Fixed bug where toggling "show hidden" switch was ineffective on current
	brower window (but did correctly affect new ones).
    Added a README.rtf file which explains what this example demonstrates.
    Added an Info panel that displays the README.rtf file.

v6 1996/01/17 05:00 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Fixed warning that showed up when compiling for debug.  Had to replace
	(int const) with #define for array size.

v5 1996/01/17 04:00 EST zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Added NameCache classes to cache user and group names since looking them
	up in NetInfo for every display and sort is excessively time
	consuming.

v4 1996/01/17 02:00 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Removed mcgh2misc conversions scripts since the one in the palette
	directory now handles the example directories automatically.

v3 1996/01/16 20:00 EST zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Fixed mcgh2misc.csh.

v2 1996/01/16 19:00 EST zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Implemented -tableScroll:intValueAt::, tagAt::, stringValueAt::
    Sorting is much faster now.
    The only slow columns are the owner and group columns.

v1 1996/01/05 13:00 EST zarnuk@zarnuk.com
    Lazy version derived from scrollDir v17 for NEXTSTEP.
