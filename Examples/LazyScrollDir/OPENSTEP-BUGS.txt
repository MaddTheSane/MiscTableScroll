BUGS:
----
- Each time a new window is opened on MacOS/X Server DR2 for Mach or YellowBox
    DR2 for Windows, it is taller than the size set with -setFrame:display: by
    the height of the menu bar.  This is an AppKit bug which was introduced in
    DR2.


NeXT BUGS:
---------
- Saving font default doesn't work (can't serialize point size error).  [I was
    storing an NSNumber in a dictionary which got saved to defaults.  I worked
    around this bug by storing a string representation of the number in the
    dictionary instead.]
- Info panel not loading README.  [I worked around this by explicitly asking
    for an "rtf" file then an "rtfd" file (if the "rtf" wasn't found).
    NSBundle is not working as advertised where it says that if you pass nil
    for the "extension", then it will find the first file with the "name"
    regardless of the "extension".]
- When browsing /LocalApps, the icons are all the same (and they are the icon
    for MallocDebug.app which isn't even in that directory)!  The
    MallocDebug.app icon shows up as the icon for *ALL* ".app" directories
    rather than the icon of the executable inside.  I tracked this down to
    MallocDebug's Info.plist:
	NSExtensions = {app = {NSIcon = Leak.tiff; NSIsPrimary = NO; }; };
    [I worked around this problem by explicitly checking for the "app"
    extension and asking for the icon of the contained executable.]
    [03/21/97 -- this bug is finally "fixed" in OPENSTEP 4.1 (gamma)]


FIXED:
-----
v19.1
- File attributes displayed for ".." are actually those for ".".
- Double-clicking on ".." does not open the parent directory.  It does
    nothing.  Note that using the "Traverse" button does work.
