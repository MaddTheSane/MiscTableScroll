v19.1 1999/08/12 21:30 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Ported to MacOS/X Server DR2 for Mach and Windows.
    Updated all nibs to latest UI layout guidelines and adjusted all fonts.
    Renamed Directory menu's New item to Open.
    Renamed Directory menu's Save item to Export.
    Added File menu.  Moved Open & Delete items to this menu.
    Added Close item to Directory menu on MacOS/X platform.
    Renamed Colors... to Show Colors, and Font Panel... to Show Fonts on
	MacOS/X platform.
    Renamed DirController's -new: to -openDirectory:.
    Renamed DirWindow's -open: to -openSelected:.
    Renamed DirWindow's -save: to -export:.
    Fixed spelling error in SD_PageLayout.nib: Botom -> Bottom.
    Changed background of Page Layout images to be transparent.  This looks
	better on all platforms.  The old light-gray background was incorrect
	for platforms other than NextStep/OpenStep Mach.
    Updated copyrignt on Info panel.
    Updated copyright and contact information in README.
    Added make.sh and platform.make to work around differences in the directory
	structure between MacOS/X Server DR2 and earlier versions of OpenStep.
	In particular, the location of the system makefiles changed, as did the
	location of the 'make' utility on Windows.
    Added patch to Makefile.postamble to eliminate NSFramework_forceLoad()
	compiler warning generated by makefiles on YellowBox DR2 for Windows.
    The user is now prompted for confirmation before deleting files via the
	File/Delete menu item.
    Moved nib files to English.lproj to support localization.
    Added unpack.sh to simplify unpacking a project with subdirectories.
    Fixed formatting of ScrollDir_main.m.
    SD_PageLayout implementation is now conditionally compiled for platforms
	which require it.
    Removed unused +[SD_PageLayout launch:].
    Fixed comments in SD_PageLayout.{h|m}.
    Some TableScroll delegate method names changed when they were turned into
	NSNotification-style messages.
    Now correctly uses -tableScrollChangeFont: rather than
	-tableScrollFontChanged: to note user instigated font change.
    For naming consistency, renamed -didClick: to -scrollClick: and
	-didDoubleClick: to -scrollDoubleClick: in DirWindow.  This is more
	consistent with other names such as -lockClick:.
    Removed Copy Font, Paste Font, Underline, Kern, Ligature, & Baseline from
	Format menu since they made no sense in this context.
    Fixed bug: Attributes displayed for ".." were actually those of ".".
    Worked around Foundation bug: -[NSString stringByDeletingLastPathComponent]
	does not handle the root directory as documented.  On Mach, when handed
	"/", it returns "" rather than "/" as documented.  On Windows, when
	handed "C:\", it returns "C:" rather than "C:\" as documented.
    Fixed bug: -[DirWindow destroy:] was mis-using result of -selectedRows and
	consequently deleting the wrong files.
    Fixed bug: Full pathname (DA_LONG_NAME) computed by DirArray was incorrect
	for "..".  It should have been the current directory's parent, but was
	instead just the current directory.  The result was that double
	clicking on ".." did not open the parent directory.
    Fixed -[DirWindow cdPressed:] to use DA_LONG_NAME instead of constructing
	the long name manually from DA_SHORT_NAME and the current path.

    Changed Files:
    * DirArray.m
    * DirController.{h|m}
    * DirWindow.{m|nib}

v18.1 1998/03/30 09:06 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Applied v18 NEXTSTEP 3.3 diffs.
    Renamed Windows menu nib:
	LazyScrollDir-winnt.nib --> LazyScrollDir-windows.nib
    Added Rhapsody-specific main menu.
    Application icon on Info panel now explicitly names "LazyScrollDir" rather
	than "NSApplicationIcon".
    DirWindow now uses NSColor's "system" color for window background by
	default, rather than hard-coded light-gray.
    DirWindow.nib now uses NSColor's "system" colors by default for
	MiscTableScroll, rather than hard-wired NextStep-like colors.
    Replaced the NSCStringText in Info.nib with an NSTextView.
    Fixed v1 bug: Wasn't respecting selected-text color.  Problem was that
	the cell's "owner" was never getting set.
    DirArray's "totalBytes" is now correctly typed as "unsigned long long"
	rather than "size_t".

    Changed Files:
    * DirArray.{h|m}

v17.1 1997/11/24 19:55 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Applied v17 NEXTSTEP 3.3 diffs.
    Fixed bug: Menu was sending -print: to first-responder which printed the
	control with keyboard focus rather than the MiscTableScroll.

    Changed Files:
    * DirWindow.{h|m|nib}
    * LazyScrollDir.nib
    * LazyScrollDir-winnt.nib

v16.1 1997/07/08 13:00 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Applied v16 NEXTSTEP 3.3 diffs.

    Changed Files:

    * Makefile.postamble

v15.1 1997/06/24 07:30 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Applied v15 NEXTSTEP 3.3 diffs.

    Changed Files:
    * DirArray.{h|m}
    * DirWindow.m

v14.3 1997/06/22 06:00 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Now works with MiscTableScroll v0.125.9.  (Method names changed.)
    Adjusted framework search path to: $(NEXT_ROOT)/LocalLibrary/Frameworks.
    Added LazyScrollDir.ico application icon for Windows NT.
    Upgraded [un]pack_binaries.sh scripts to handle ICO files.

    * Makefile

    * PB.project
    * unpack_binaries.sh

v14.2 1997/04/25 20:00 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Now works with MiscTableScroll v0.125.8.
    Synchronized with ScrollDir v29.4 for OPENSTEP.
    Ported to OPENSTEP 4.2 prerelease for Mach and NT.
    Replaced the Unix specific directory scanning code with NSFileManager.
    Removed the "message" column since this information isn't available
	from the NSFileManager.
    Completely revamped DirArray.  Is now completely Objective-C rather than
	Objective-C / C mixture.
    Added a Windows NT specific main menu nib.
    Replaced assert() with NSAssert() variations.
    Removed obsolete NameCache class.  No longer needed since NSFileManager
	returns string versions of file owner's user and group.  Removed
	reference to NameCache from README.
    Added MiscTableScroll to Frameworks directory in project since it is
	now a framework.
    Upgraded pack.sh script to store minor version number in PACKAGE_NUMBER.
    Upgraded binary pack and unpack scripts so they don't error out if tiffs
	or nibs are non-existent.

    Applied v11 NEXTSTEP 3.3 diffs.
    (v10 was an experimental version which was never released, and therefore
    never ported to OPENSTEP.)
    Now works with OPENSTEP MiscTableScroll v125.3 (many MiscTableScroll method
	names changed since v9 of this project).

v9.3 1996/12/30 02:30 EST sunshine@sunshineco.com
    Ported to broken OPENSTEP 4.1 (gamma) pb_makefiles.

v9.2 1996/05/07 08:00 EDT sunshine@sunshineco.com
    TableScroll class version numbers were bumped up for all classes which
	archive themselves.  Therefore converted the DirWindow nib.
